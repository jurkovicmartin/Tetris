Classis Tetris game done in Python with Pygame. I personally love the Tetris game, so as a little project i made one myself. The main functionality was implemented with matrix, which represents the playing field, and operations on this matrix. The solution isn't optimal, especially the shapes rotating logic, but the most important thing is solution the game works.

## Controls

- **Space** = for game start
- **WASD** / **Arrows**  = shapes controlling
- **H** = hold the current shape
- **P** = Pause
- **R** = Resets the game
- **ESC** = Quits the game

The **score** is count of filled lines.
